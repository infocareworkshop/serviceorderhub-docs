# Webhooks

During the service's life cycle both participants (the partner, who orders the service, and the service provider) update information in the service order hub.

On certain events we send webhooks. Today we support two transports for them: HTTP to the URL you provide or putting a message into an AMQP queue on your side. Both can be sent only in JSON.

For HTTP transport we support GET/POST/PUT/PATH/DELETE methods and any custom constant headers.

We can set up for each webhook which version of API will be used to generate body (Except Status transition where only `v3` is available).

By default we use `v1`.

### Request Id

Since v3 we add a field with GUID to track requests. When HTTP transport is used we add a custom header `x-request-id`. For AMQP transport we add `_requestId`field straight to the message body. They are unique per webhook event, not per request call. I.e. you can receive more then one request with the same requestId, but all of them will have the same body and the same event-trigger.

### Replying to webhooks

To improve stability we introduced a special replying logic. Receivers of webhooks should send a notification to Hub to confirm that they received that message and processed it correctly (or not). If no notification received we mark request failed and can perform some steps to recover it. We can enable this workflow for any webhook on demand. Also we can set up custom reaction timeout.

### Failover policy

We can set up request repetition for any webhook. If we failed to send it, or failed to get a reply, we can resend it. If the data is completely wrong and there is no chance that it will be restored, the client can stop repetition by sending a special reply status. See `POST /api/v3/requests/log` for more details.

We resend failed reqiests in non-linear time intervals depending on reply timeout using the formula:

```
timeout = (failedAttempts + 1) * (failedAttempts + 2) * replyTimeout * 0.5
```

For 30s timeout the request will be sent after 00:00:30, then 00:01:30, 00:03:00, 00:05:00, 00:07:30, 00:10:30 and so on.


## New status

For more information about statuses [read here](Working%20with%20cases/#post-apiv3casestatus)

Example:
```
{
  "guid": "a7afaf9-7c6e-4d0e-b756-16b4afa1382f", // Case guid
  "name": "Repair finished",
  "key": "final",
  "createdAt": "2019-01-22T11:29:38.258Z",
  "updatedAt": "2019-01-22T11:29:38.258Z",
  "declaredAt": "2019-01-22T11:27:34.233Z"
}
```

## Status transition

We can set up webhooks to send them conditionally:

- If new status has specific key
- If some specific status was changed to any other
- If some specific status changed to another specific status

The webhook body will be almost the same as for new status, but with addition of `prevKey` and `case` fields.

```
{
  "id": 123,
  "guid": "a7afaf9-7c6e-4d0e-b756-16b4afa1382f", // Case guid
  "name": "Repair finished",
  "key": "final", // Current status key
  "prevKey": "arrived", // Previous status key
  "createdAt": "2019-01-22T11:29:38.258Z",
  "updatedAt": "2019-01-22T11:29:38.258Z",
  "declaredAt": "2019-01-22T11:27:34.233Z",
  "case": {
    // Case data
  }
}
```

We use partner statuses after mapping for status webhooks for `key` and `prevKey`.
When there is no any mapping found, we use provider status as is. 
We can add some statuses to "black list" and webhooks won't be sent and they will be invisible.
This feature is useful when provider has many intermediate statuses and partner is interested only in some of them.

Also note that both "New status" and "Status transition" can be fired simultaneously.


## New cost proposal

For more information about cost proposals [read here](Cost%20proposal%20API/)

Example:
```
{
  "id": 25532, // unique cost proposal id
  "guid": "f5afa004-f48c-4380-9f9b-cafaea0dd7de", // Case guid
  "externalId": null,
  "name": "RUR", //most common values are "Repair", "RUR" (Return UnRepaired), "Scrap"
  "priceNet": 280,
  "currency": "SEK",
  "isActive": true,
  "dateValidUntil": null,
  "reaction": null,
  "comment": null,
  "reactionDate": null,
  "reactionName": null,
  "details": [
    {
      "line": 1,
      "text": "Return unrepaired fee",
      "type": "RUR",
      "priceNet": 280,
      "quantity": 1
    }
  ],

  "updatedAt": "2019-11-25T10:43:20.523Z",
  "serviceProviderId": 1
}
```

## Cost proposal reacted

Two different webhooks for accepted and rejected cost proposals. The body is same as in "New cost proposal".

## Cost proposal changed

Triggers after cost proposal was changed including acceptance/rejection.

## New message

For more information about messages [read here](Messages/)

This webhook can't be send to the party who actually sent the message, only to the party receieving it

Example:
```
{
  "id": 59076, // message's unique id
  "guid": "f5afa004-f48c-4380-9f9b-cc9afa0dd7de", // case guid
  "content": "The external workshop updated the status to Product received.",
  "type": "serviceComment",
  "createdAt": "2019-11-25T10:33:54.283Z",
  "updatedAt": "2019-11-25T10:33:54.283Z"
}
```

## New file uploaded

For more information about file upload [read here](Working%20with%20cases/#post-apiv3casefiles)

Example:
```
{
  "guid": "f5afa004-f48c-4380-9f9b-cc9afa0dd7de", // case guid
  "files": [
    {
      "url": "http://publicly-available-link-to-download-the-file.com/2a6bc44d-81b2-4512-8b83-e6da349fab3f-201920072424556.pdf",
      "name": "201920072424556.pdf",
      "type": "other" // FileType
    }
  ]
}
```
For more information about file types [read here](Data%20types%20and%20structures/#FileType)

## Case created

The body is similar to `GET /api/v3/case/export`

## Case updated

The webhook's body is similar to the input of [POST /api/v2/case/update](Working%20with%20cases/#post-apiv2caseupdate)

If any key was removed, we send it with `null` value.

Unchanged keys are not being sent in the webhook.

If a key has a new value, we send the new value assigned to that key.

Array is considered as a single value.

The webhook's body will always contain the `guid` field. Also it can have some top-level keys: `orderData`, `productData`, `customer`, `consumer`, `pickupDst`, `returnDst`.

This webhook can be sent either to a partner or to a provider. It depends on the role of the user who submitted the update request.
Also it can be triggered both by an API request and using the Web interface.

Example:
```
{
  "guid": "989d0f73-f87a-4dfe-98eb-554a44233cef",
  "orderData": {
    "refNo": "REF",
    "serial": null
  },
  "productData": {
    "model": "Tesla Cybertruck",
    "accessory": [
      "1180"
    ]
  },
  "consumer": {
    "firstName": "Elon",
    "lastName": "Musk"
  },
  "sender": {
    "address": "Somestreet, 123"
  }
}
```

## Case was accepted by Service Provider

Triggered after the provider sents a request to `case/accept`. The body is similar to `GET /api/v3/case/export`. Can be triggered multiple times, after each request from the provider.
